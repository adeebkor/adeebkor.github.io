I am a senior lecturer in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University
of Malaya. Prior to my lectureship, I was a [PhD
student](https://garth-wells.github.io/) at the University of Cambridge. My PhD
research focused on the development of a fast, high-order finite element solver
for focused ultrasound applications. My research interests include computational
science and engineering, high-performance computing, and open-source software
development.
